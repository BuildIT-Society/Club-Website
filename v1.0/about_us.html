		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>There’s a clear gap between what students know and what students can do.<br> More often than not, real life experience and practical abilities mark<br> the difference between getting the internship of your dreams or just another tedious<br> resume-builder job. We seek to narrow that gap by getting our members involved with<br> unique projects that they’re genuinely excited about. We realize that organizations<br> that build cool things are abound, but oftentimes, they’re focused on a single area,<br> or are so big that you end up contributing close to nothing on a certain<br> project that you’re involved in. BuildIT Society teams will never be comprised of more<br> than 10 members, and will always be focused on a project chosen via a majority of votes. </p>
